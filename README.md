# conflictchecker

1. conflicts regarding partners (not enough, too much)

# scioconversion
automates conversion between sorted by people and sorted by event 

# medaltracker
automates conversion between event-medal and people-event csvs into a people-medal csv. diff versions = diff. ways of sorting these medals... since idk what the logi status quo is rn haha!

currently only works with each csv being for a specific competition; intercompetition analysis coming soon?

# future plans
- epic front end dev. with bxscioly website to allow all logistics members easy data analysis for team selection
- collating past data (~2019 to present) to determine correlation bt various metrics & actual results
- data analysis across years/competitions with past data
- **reducing logistics annoyances (e.g. time conflicts and other constraints) through an intuitive interface to create teams w/ auto reminders if there are issues**

- making this stuff easy to transfer between people (futureproofing) (basically adding tons of documentation)
